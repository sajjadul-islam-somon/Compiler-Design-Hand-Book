# Compiler Design Hand Book
<p style="font-size: 12px;"> This book serves as a comprehensive and practical guide to the laboratory component of the Compiler Design course. It combines foundational theory with hands-on coding exercises to help students understand how compilers are built from the ground up.<br>
Each lab work focuses on a specific concept in compiler construction—such as lexical analysis, parsing, grammar transformations, or intermediate code generation—and is paired with relevant C programming implementations. To reinforce learning, every lab includes practice problems and viva questions.<br>
By the end of this book, readers will have explored and implemented essential components of a compiler, gaining both theoretical insight and practical experience.
